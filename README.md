Here I host some sites for some of my projects:

- [ðŸŽ¼ JJ's Piano Playing Docs ðŸŽ¹](https://jjvanzon.github.io/Piano-Playing-Docs/README.html)
    - Piano playing is a hobby of mine. Here I try to organize my thoughts about it. And share documents I may make. I also made some recordings.
- [ðŸ”µ Circular Language Spec ðŸ”¶](https://jjvanzon.github.io/Circular-Language-Spec/)
    - Circular aims to become a visual programming language made from shapes and lines. It may once become a diagram notation for visualizing computer code.
    - This is an attempt at a specification of this language.
